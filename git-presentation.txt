Basic git for solo work:

    - create a local repository
    - add files to track
    - create a .gitignore file
    - commit changes to a file
        - talk about when to commit, often
        - talk about commit statement
        - mention empty commits for notes/labbook, git features like notes
            and tags
    - remove and move files using git and without git
    - show git log to view history
    - revert and/or reset unwanted changes and retrieve removed file
    - talk about general workflow with git

A little more sophisticated solo work:

    - create branch for unfinished/untested code
    - merge branches with and without conflicts
        - talk about workflows to avoid conflicts
        - show at least one way of resolving conflicts
    - create backup repository on cluster or github
    - push and pull from the backup
    - emphasize workflow again!

Working with a group:

    - cloning an existing repository
    - emphasize work flow!!!
        - pull, merge, work, commit, pull, merge, push

We also want to include links to the git home and documentation pages, the
tutorials we find most useful, as well as an overall cheatsheet for commands.
And I just thought a sheet depicting good workflow may be nice too.
